"""Triton kernels for segment-grouped LoRA matmuls.

Adapted from sglang's S-LoRA / Punica style kernels.  Each batch is a
sequence of segments where each segment uses a single adapter; the kernels
fuse the per-segment GEMMs into a single launch and keep per-segment state
(rank, scaling) on-device.
